# Challenges

This repo collects some exercises I've made to practice algorithms and data structures.

Most of them are from [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and you can find a link to the exercices in each source file.

*Disclaimer: I am not proud of all of them, but I try not to modify old files to see the evolution in the newest files I submit. eg: cleaner code, more performant code due to use of right data structures, algorithms, etc...*
